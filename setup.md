# Video Encoder Client Setup

### Prerequisites 
- Linux server capable of encoding videos in a timely manne. (good internet, processor)
- Basic understand of CLI commands

Step 1:

```
apt install git docker-compose
```
Step 2:
```
git clone https://github.com/spknetwork/video-encoder.git
cd video-encoder
```

Step 3:
`
This step might take awhile
`
```
docker-compose up
```

Once it's running it must be stopped with ctrl-c so we can configure it further.

Now, there will be a folder inside the directory labeled `data`. 
Inside that directory there will be two more files. The first being IPFS (ignore it) and the other will be labeled `video-encoder`. 
Inside the video-encoder folder there will be a file called `config` (open this with your editor of choice)

Pay attention to the section inside `node { }` and `gateway_client { }`. Everything else can be left the same.

First off change gateway_url to `https://encoder-gateway.infra.3speak.tv` with quotes around it.

Next up modify the cryptoAccounts section and set hive to your HIVE username. If you wish to receive rewards.

Please note, the privateKey inside the node section is NOT your HIVE private key. It is autogenerated by the node upon start and is used to uniquely identify your node.

Finally, change the `name` variable in the `node` section to something nice and easily identifiable. 

From here, you can start the encoder and start processing jobs as they become available.

You will want to test your changes first
```
docker-compose up 
```
Then once verified the node is running background the process by restarting the app with
```
docker-compose up -d
```
